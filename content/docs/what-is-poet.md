Poet is a modern static site generator written in Rust. It's designed to enable semantic analysis of content using natural language processing and to integrate your content with AI agents and platforms.

Key features:
- Can be installed from a single binary file with no dependencies
- Uses JSX-like syntax for creating layouts
- Templates and markdown files share the same context, so that you can use components and variables in the same way across both
- Exposes an MCP server from your content and makes it RAG-enabled
